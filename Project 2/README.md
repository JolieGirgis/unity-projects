This project is a top down game in which the objective is to feed animals spawning from all sides before they leave the player's screen. 

Features:
- Lives system: Player is given 3 lives. If they fail to feed an animal before it moves off the screen or if they collide with an animal, a life is deducted.
- Score system: When an animal is fully fed, it disappears and the player is given a point.
- Spawn system: Random animals spawn from the top and sides of the screen. Each animal has a food bar and when the player feeds them enough to fill the food bar, they disappear. 
- Each animal has a different speed and requires a different amount of food to be full.
